* __Version:__ 0.0.1
* __Quick summary:__ This is a personal project for playing with Marvel API [https://developer.marvel.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/).  
Current version allows you to get some data from comics and characters. Next releases are expected to
expand the forms of filtering and allow the search for new entities like creators, events, series and stories.  
*"The Marvel Comics API allows developers everywhere to access information about Marvel's vast 
library of comics â€” from what's coming up, to 70 years ago."*  
Keep up to date and find out some geek stuff!
