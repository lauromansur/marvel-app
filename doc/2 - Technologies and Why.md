# Technologies and Why #

## Guidelines ##
* __Material Design__: visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation and possibility of technology and science; a single underlying system that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes
* __Mobile first__: designing an online experience for mobile before designing it for the desktop Web

## Application Core ##
* __AngularJS__: is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications
* __AngularJS Material__: UI Component framework and a reference implementation of Google's Material Design Specification

## Version Control ##
* __Git__: a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency
* __Bitbucket (for development environment)__: a web-based hosting service that is owned by Atlassian, used for source code and development projects that use either Mercurial or Git revision control systems. Used for development environment for offering private repositories in free account.
* __Github (for production environment)__: a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. Used for production environment for offering only public repositories in free account.

## Package Manager ##
* __Node/NPM__: node is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## Build automation ##
* __GruntJS__: a JavaScript Task Runner used to automatically perform frequently used tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc.

## CSS Framework ##
* __SASS__: helps keep large stylesheets well-organized, and get small stylesheets up and running quickly

## Testing Framework ##
* __Karma__: is a direct product of the AngularJS team from struggling to test their own framework features with existing tools. As a result of this, they made Karma and rightly suggest it as their preferred test runner within the AngularJS documentation.
* __Jasmine__: is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code that plays very well with Karma. Similar to Karma, it’s also the recommended testing framework within the AngularJS documentation. Jasmine is also dependency free and doesn’t require a DOM.
